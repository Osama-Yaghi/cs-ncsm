# Nuclear Structure Analysis Tools

This repository contains Python scripts that help analyze the raw results of the Manyeffv3b.exe program.
The tools focus on two main functions: reading and analyzing eigenvalues data 
from many-body calculations, and analyzing resonance data with respect to 
benchmark results. 

## spectrum_reader.py
`spectrum_reader.py` is a Python script designed to read, organize, and visualize 
eigenvalues data from many-body nuclear structure calculations. The tool enables 
users to read data, update it, remove it, and plot various visualizations of the data 
for nuclear structure analysis. It is primarily used to interact with data files 
generated by the `manyeffv3b` code.

### Functions

- `readfiles(nucleus, name1, replace=False)`: Reads all output files containing eigenvalue data and stores them in a pandas DataFrame.
- `load(nucleus)`: Loads the DataFrame from the stored file of the given nucleus.
- `update(nucleus, name1)`: Updates the nucleus DataFrame with data from new files.
- `remove_data(nucleus)`: Removes data from the nucleus DataFrame.
- `plot_complex_plane(num_p, first_param, second_param)`: Visualizes eigenvalues in the complex plane with various parameter settings.
- `general_plot(par_x, st_num, extra_param)`: Plots energy as a function of a general parameter, with optional multiple curves for different extra parameters.
- `track_state_rotation(states=[])`: Tracks the rotation of states to determine resonances based on ABC theorem predictions.
- `plot_rotation_hw(num_p)`: Plots eigenvalues in the complex plane for different hw values.
- `resonance_hwconv`: Plots the convergence of energy vs N_max for various states.

##Detailed info
run spectrum_reader.help() or simply the code itsef: python spectrum_reader.py 
to get detailed info on each function and how to use it.

## resoanance_search.py

resonance_search.py is a script used to read resonance data stored in .pkl dictionaries
and plot energy levels diagrams. It allows comparison with benchmark data (e.g., from R-matrix analysis).
### Functions
-energy_levels(file_names, nucleus, bar_style, plot_thresholds, comparison): Loads resonance files and compares them to a benchmark defined by the comparison parameter.
-quick(nuclei1): Calculates the expected critical angle of resonances based on R-matrix analysis data.
